# Diamond Price Prediction Model Readme
This readme provides an overview of the diamond price prediction model, its deployment process, and the necessary steps to run it.

# Overview
The diamond price prediction model is a machine learning model that uses various diamond features such as carat, cut, clarity, and color to predict the price of a diamond. The model has been trained on a large dataset of diamond prices and their corresponding features to make accurate price predictions.

# Dependencies
The following dependencies are required to run the diamond price prediction model:

- Python 3.x
- Flask 2.0.1
- scikit-learn 1.0.2
- NumPy 1.21.1
- Pandas 1.3.1

# Project Structure
Project Structure is made in such a manner that in order make automation.

1. `artifacts`: Here we will store preprocesses data, model pickle file, different pickle - file w.r.t Feature Engineering and data preprocessing pipline etc.
2. `Notebook` : having jupyterfile of EDA, Featureb Engineering, data for modeling.
3. `src`: having entire project machine learning modulus. 
    - `Pipline` : Here two major pipline Training and prediction.
         - `Training Pipline`: It is composed of various components such as 'Data ingestion` (Reading data from Sources), Data Transformation, Model trainier(trained with  different model, Model Evaluation.
         - `Prediction pipline` : It will take input data from client side and give predict from model to client side.

# Model Deployment
The diamond price prediction model can be deployed using Flask, a lightweight Python web framework. To deploy the model, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Install the dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Flask application using python app.py


# Model Maintenance
To maintain the diamond price prediction model, the following tasks should be performed periodically:

- Update the training dataset with new data to improve the model's accuracy.
- Monitor the model's performance to identify any issues or anomalies.
- Update the dependencies as needed to ensure compatibility and security.

# Conclusion
The diamond price prediction model is a powerful tool for predicting the price of diamonds based on their features. By following the steps outlined in this readme, you can deploy and use the model in your own applications.
